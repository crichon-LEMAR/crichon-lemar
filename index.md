# Welcome to my page !

I am Dr Camille Richon, a biogeochemical oceanographer, currently working as a CNRS researcher at LEMAR in Brest, France. 
My main research interests focus on anthropogenic impacts on ocean biogeochemistry. 

I use numerical models, at global or regional scales, to decipher complex interactions between climate, pollution and biogeochemical tracers (nutrients, plankton...). 

My current research projects mostly focus on microplastic pollution and its impacts on the global ocean ecosystems and biogeochemical functioning.
