# PREVENT <img src="{% link images/logo.jpeg %}" alt="Logo du PPR PREVENT" width="100">

PREVENT studies the oceanic exposome and the combined effects of historical and emerging pollutants on marine organisms and ecosystems.

The project aims to:

Better understand the mechanisms controlling the distribution of key metals (mercury and lithium) and microplastics in the water column, their transfer through the food web, and the impact of their toxicity on marine organisms and ecosystems, through a combined experimental and modeling approach.

Develop numerical models to study the impact of pollutants on marine ecosystems and their future evolution in the context of climate change and the energy transition.

Co-construct, together with stakeholders (policy makers, civil society, companies, etc.), action plans to regulate future contaminant emissions and reduce their impact on the ocean, based on the new knowledge generated within the project.

# BubblePlast
In the marine environment, macroplastic wastes undergo chemical and physical modifications leading to their fragmentation into microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs). Additional MPs and potentially NPs enter the Oceans via rivers and atmospheric deposition. To date, the fate of ocean plastic debris is far to be understood and this is especially true when it comes to small MPs and NPs. Besides, the established presence of MPs in the atmospheric compartment, found in urbanized areas but also in remote locations, and the potential presence of NPs are of growing concern. These plastic particles can influence the Earth’s climate and degrade air quality.

A transfer of plastic particles from the oceans to the atmosphere has recently been hypothesized. Literature strongly suggests this sea-to-air transfer of MPs/NPs processes similarly as for the generation of primary marine aerosols (sea spray aerosols) i.e., via the bursting of air bubbles plumes at the ocean’s surface. Nevertheless, the magnitude and significance of this phenomenon for both the marine and atmospheric compartments are still controversial. In this project, we hypothesize these marine MPs and NPs emissions are significant at the global scale and contribute to marine dispersal of MPs and NPs to remote ocean regions, and to terrestrial and cryospheric parts of the Earth system. We propose an innovative and complementary approach to address two objectives: 1. assess the water-to-air transfer of MPs and NPs particles and their co-contaminants via bubble bursting as a function of environmental parameters and plastic particle properties using laboratory experiments, 2. improve ocean and atmosphere models of MPs and NPs, and their coupling, to understand MPs/NPs transport and cycling.
